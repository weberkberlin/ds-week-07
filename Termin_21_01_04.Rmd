This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(RODBC)
library(tidyverse)
library(rvg)
library(dplyr)
library(xlsx)

locale_ger <- locale(decimal_mark = ".")

setwd("C:/Users/konra/tubCloud/Uni/20WiSe/DataScience/Daten_20_11_23")

drt_trips <- read_delim("pave188b.drt_trips.csv.gz", delim = ";", locale = locale_ger, col_types = cols(personId = col_character()))

all_trips <- read_delim("pave188b.output_trips.csv.gz", delim = ";", locale = locale_ger, col_types = cols(person = col_character()))

ggplot(data = drt_trips, mapping = aes(x=fromX, y=fromY)) +
  geom_point(size=0.2, alpha=0.1, color="#008080") +
  coord_quickmap()

ggplot(data = all_trips, mapping = aes(x=start_x, y=start_y)) +
  geom_hex(binwidth=5000) +
  geom_point(size=0.2, alpha=0.1, color="#008080")

ggplot(all_trips) +
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x=dep_time, fill = main_mode), binwidth = 2000)

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
